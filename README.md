# 💾 Windows 95 Portfolio

> *"It's not a bug, it's a feature!"* - Windows 95, probably

Welcome to my digital time capsule! This isn't your average portfolio – this is a fully functional Windows 95 desktop experience that showcases my skills, projects, and personality through pure 90s nostalgia. Built with React, TypeScript, and a whole lot of love for pixelated perfection.

## 🖥️ System Requirements

- **OS**: Any modern browser (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+)
- **RAM**: 640KB ought to be enough for anybody
- **Graphics**: 256 colors recommended for authentic experience

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
# Clone this repository like it's 1995
git clone https://github.com/alishirani1384/win95-portfolio.git

# Navigate to the directory
cd win-portfolio

# Install dependencies (npm didn't exist in 95, but we adapt)
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev

# Boom! Your desktop awaits at http://localhost:5173
```

## 🎮 Features

### 🗂️ Authentic Desktop Experience

- **Taskbar**: Fully functional with system tray and clock
- **Windows**: Draggable, resizable, minimizable, maximizable – the works!

### 📁 Interactive Applications
- **📄 Resume.exe**: My professional experience in a familiar WordPad-style window
- **📧 Contact.exe**: Reach out through a retro email client interface
- **🖼️ My Projects**: Browse my work in an Explorer-style file manager

### 🎨 Visual Fidelity

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| **Framework** | React 18 with TypeScript |
| **Styling** | CSS Modules + Styled Components |
| **State Management** | Zustand (because Redux is too 2010s) |
| **Build Tool** | Vite (lightning fast, like a 56k modem) |
| **Icons** | Custom pixel art + Windows 95 icon extraction |

## 🙋‍♂️ About Me

Hi! I'm the developer who clearly spent way too much time perfecting the Windows 95 minimize animation. When I'm not recreating 90s operating systems in React, I build modern web applications and occasionally touch grass.

**Fun fact**: This portfolio was built entirely while listening to the Windows 95 startup sound on loop. Send help.
