# 💾 Windows 95 Portfolio

> *"It's not a bug, it's a feature!"* - Windows 95, probably

Welcome to my digital time capsule! This isn't your average portfolio – this is a fully functional Windows 95 desktop experience that showcases my skills, projects, and personality through pure 90s nostalgia. Built with React, TypeScript, and a whole lot of love for pixelated perfection.

## 🖥️ System Requirements

- **OS**: Any modern browser (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+)
- **RAM**: 640KB ought to be enough for anybody
- **Graphics**: 256 colors recommended for authentic experience
- **Sound**: Sound Blaster 16 compatible (just kidding, Web Audio API works fine)

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
# Clone this repository like it's 1995
git clone https://github.com/alishirani1384/win95-portfolio.git

# Navigate to the directory
cd win-portfolio

# Install dependencies (npm didn't exist in 95, but we adapt)
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev

# Boom! Your desktop awaits at http://localhost:5173
```

## 🎮 Features

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| **Framework** | React 18 with TypeScript |
| **Styling** | CSS Modules + Styled Components |
| **State Management** | Zustand (because Redux is too 2010s) |
| **Build Tool** | Vite (lightning fast, like a 56k modem) |
| **Audio** | Web Audio API |
| **Icons** | Custom pixel art + Windows 95 icon extraction |

## 🎯 Easter Eggs

> **🔍 Pro tip**: Try right-clicking on the desktop or double-clicking the recycle bin. You might find some surprises!

- **Secret Soundboard**: Hidden audio controls with classic Windows sounds
- **Time Travel Clock**: Right-click the system tray clock for different time formats

## 🙋‍♂️ About Me

Hi! I'm the developer who clearly spent way too much time perfecting the Windows 95 minimize animation. When I'm not recreating 90s operating systems in React, I build modern web applications and occasionally touch grass.

**Fun fact**: This portfolio was built entirely while listening to the Windows 95 startup sound on loop. Send help.
